# xCT+

Created for optimal performance in the toughest fights, a rugged combat text add-on is finally ready to be put to the 
test!

## Overview

xCT+ is immensely based off the add-on xCT by braindump (aka Affli). It strives to be as minimalistic as possible while 
maintaining ease of use. That is why, introduced in version 3, you can now configure all settings while in-game.

Overall, xCT+ is a replacement for Blizzard’s scrolling combat text. It is superior to the default combat text because 
xCT+ organizes incoming healing, incoming damage, and outgoing damage/healing into their own frames, while minimizing 
spam.
 
## Features

For those that have used Affli’s xCT Add-On, xCT+ expands the functionality of its predecessor. New features include:

* An In-Game Configuration Tool
* Frames for tracking Criticals, Loot and Money, Spell Procs and Unit Power (e.g. Mana)
* A grid when positioning the frames
* Tons of new options and features
* A redesigned Spell Merger to cut down on the spam
* Profiles
* And many more exciting new features!

## The future of xCT+ in TWW and beyond

As of TWW Season 1, [Dandruff](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tdandruff) (Dandruff-Stormreaver US) resigned from addon development and gave [RedAces](https://www.curseforge.com/members/redaces) (Feylynn-Antonidas EU) the 
permission to develop xCT+ further. He has aided development since mid Dragonflight and will continue to fix and 
enhance xCT+.

### Version 4.9.0
Version 4.9.0 shapes up to be a major rewrite of the whole addon. The following features are currently in it:

* a lot of cleanup (!)
* a lot of bugfixes (!)
* use more headers in the options GUI because the descriptions are sometimes only displayed as "..."
* allow hiding the auto attack icons for outgoing attacks
* only register xCT as LibSink target if any other addon has loaded LibSink. Remove LibSink from embedded libraries
* show fully absorbed outgoing damage events as normal damage events (if enabled)
* add partially absorbed outgoing damage to the amount to show the full damage we did (if enabled)
* fix the handling of DK runes coming off CD
* The spell value filter now works AFTER merging!
  * e. g. if the spell filter is set for >= 100k damage, then 2x 60k damage events will be merged and displayed as 120k (x2) 
  * Before this change, nothing was displayed because each damage event was filtered before merging
* add notification for profession skill ups (if enabled)
* replace "OnUpdate" function for delayed loot display with a AceTimer schedule
* add new frame "outgoing" healing
  * Spam Merger now wont merge heal + damage if the Spell ID is the same (e. g. DK consumption, Death Strike)
* Major overhaul of the spam merger
  * cleanup merges of older expansions and rearrange them
  * let the player set the merge interval for everything we are currently merging
  * fix dispell merging
  * Spam merger now should display more OnUpdate in order to show all waiting messages
* modernize spell filter options: you can now delete an entry completely via an select (unsorted for now)
* Split xCT into a main addon and an options addon to reduce the footprint.
  * The main addon has a RAM footprint of about 800 KB, and the options of 1,8 MB ... wow!

Feel free to try the alpha and beta versions and provide feedback in GitHub!
